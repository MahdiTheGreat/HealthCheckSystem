# HealthCheckSystem
this is a health care system,which with the appropriate sensors can monitor a persons health,by checking the blood pressure,suger,an abnormality in blood and even if the 
patient had a fall or not(unconscious).
it is written in verilog,and therefore it is appropriate to implement with the help of an fpga,which costs less thant a microprocessor,and is a good fit for the prototyping state.
